                <p>Hi, I am John Canoy, a 21-year-old BSIT student in my 3rd year at St. Cecilia's College. I have an identical twin brother, which often leads to some fun and confusing moments. I have a deep passion for online gaming, where I find both excitement and a sense of community. While I enjoy connecting with others online, I tend to be introverted in person, especially when I'm around people I don't know well.

                    One of the most important things about me is that I'm a mama's boy. My biggest motivation is to see my mother happy, and I'm willing to do everything just to make that happen. My family is my source of strength, and I strive to make them proud by excelling in my studies. As I work towards graduating, I'm determined to push through the challenges and obstacles that come my way, with my sights set on achieving my dreams and building a successful future.</p>
